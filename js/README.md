# Web model training

This is the code for training the model for classifying different lego bricks. There is a version of this hosted on [cloudflare](https://block-recognition.pages.dev/) that can be used to train the model on the dataset in this repository. Once the model has run, copy and paste the value in the grey box below "Model output:" into a file and pass it into your custom program! A partial implementation of the code that would run on a robot can be found in the robot section of this repository.
